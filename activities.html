    <h1>Activities</h1>
    <p>While the peace and tranquility of our guests is our priority, many prefer to relax, read or write, we also offer a number of unobtrusive activities at the Malibu Island Resort.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the activities that our guests enjoy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MOUNTAIN BIKING -  Malibu Resort mountain biking opportunities for adventurous travellers as well as experienced cyclists. No real mountain biking experience is required, and you can choose from a variety of itineraries that range from very mild to rather wild, or a more laid-back, relaxed mountain biking trip that involves a mixture of back-road and off-road sections.</li>
        <li>KAYAKING - We provide muscle-powered sea kayaks. Sea kayaking is an excellent natural approach to visit the uninhabited Islands and the largely untouched bays nearby our Resort. Hidden in the Islands are numerous caves, tunnels and lagoons, better known as ‘hongs’ (Thai for room). There is a good chance to see wildlife by this silent approach. We recommend that you bring drinking water, sun cream, sun glasses, a hat and a light, long sleeved shirt.</li>
        <li>YOGA - Yoga deeply relaxes the body, mind and soul. The stretching and breathing induce a sense of balance and calm. We offer free yoga classes twice per week and private classes may be booked through the spa.</li>
